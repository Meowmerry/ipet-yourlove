    title: " 1. Glucosamine",
    detail:
      "As pets age, their joints become abit more fragile, a bit stiffer, and simple things like walks can be tough. To help ease joint pain, glucosamine can be an excellent supplement for your older pet. Glucosamine is used as a preventative for joints, not a treatment. Once your pet is suffering from arthritis, glucosamine can only do so much to help the joints. With moderate to severe arthritis, most animals require prescription medications and other supplements to help them.Be aware of the store bought diets that claim to have joint support. They do not contain high enough levels of glucosamine to be beneficial for your pet."

    detail:
      "  This supplement is most commonly used in the treatment of skin allergies. Mackerel, tuna, salmon, sturgeon, mullet, bluefish, anchovies, sardines, herring, and trout are all loaded to the gills (pun intended) with omega-3 and are common sources of fish oil supplements. The fatty acids with the greatest health benefits are docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Both are ingredients found on the labels of fish oil supplements. A high-quality fish oil can also be supplemented into your pet’s diet to give their coat a healthy, shiny glow.."
